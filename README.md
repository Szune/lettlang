# Lettlang

**Experimental, I don't know how to write programming languages and I usually don't write Rust code**

âš  **This is something I'm writing for fun in my free time, it's not meant to be professional, it's got comments in different languages, it's going to be buggy, messy, poorly formatted, and incoherent in general** âš 

âš  **It's not intended for others to use or learn from (I imagine you're better off not having read the code)** âš 

âš  **If the code makes you feel like less of an impostor, I'd consider that a win** âš 

âš  **If the code makes you feel like more of an impostor (I don't think that's going to happen),
consider that sometimes incomprehensible code is just incomprehensible code** âš 

âš  **Consider it a public backup of code that maybe shouldn't be public** âš 


Now, what can Lettlang do at this time?

```
;; define a throw infix operator
let x `ðŸ˜¥` y = prelude_throw "intentionally threw"
"oh" ðŸ˜¥ "no"

;; with the unit value instead of strings
() ðŸ˜¥ ()

;; and more, but that's not documented, sorry
```
